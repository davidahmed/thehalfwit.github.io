# Simple Matrix Operations
Sum Matrices [ Unit 2 Sum of Matrix ]
* To compute matrix addition
* to compute scalar multiplication
* to invert a grayscale image with matrix arithmetic
* manipulate colors of an image with matrix arithmetic.
* - Get inverted -M + 255(1). Playing with R G B
* -combining two images. Linear Combination of two images (why? we dont want them to go beyond 255.) added effects. fade away. Concwz cobnation (insert eh eq)
