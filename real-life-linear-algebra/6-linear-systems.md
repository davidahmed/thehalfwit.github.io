# Systems of Linear Equations, Image Manipulation, and Encryption
### Sloving a system of linear equations.
Gaussian Elimination. 
### The three elementary operations for solving linear systems.
### An application of the two row operations on image manipulation.
### Encryption using linear algebra- 1
Caesar Cipher
1. Letters are assigned a number in the form of a vector.
2. Add a shift to the vector. V+ shift * u
### Encruption using linear algebra- 2
Shift Cipher    
Encryption using a matrix. This uses the idea of linear systems and inverse matrices as keys.
